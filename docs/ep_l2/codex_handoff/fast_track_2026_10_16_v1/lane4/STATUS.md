# Lane 4 review_r7 — source fix delivered, runtime qualification pending

Status: SOURCE_REFERENCE_SYNC_IMPLEMENTED_CPP_QUALIFICATION_DEPENDENCY_PENDING.
Read full r7 at99e7515f81b0038ac49d274b73f774e8ea801e46; original
6c136e2a scientific contract unchanged. Continued both original execution
branches `hrl/ep-l2-ft20261016-lane4-v1`, without restarting a Goal.

Frozen tooling: `705cd7b30d825cd1d9887e48427475a126d9bc83`.
New Core source: `8ff56eb0804a027f1e253e629dd2915b02bc03b5`; pushed and fetched exact same SHA.

This is UNCOMPILED/NOT_QUALIFIED source, not official R1.1. No new binary,
application config/trace identity or run key. Old b8b3/438df runtime/binary are
preserved in the previous receipt, not attributed to this new source.

## Actual work completed

- Precisely adapted to Lane1 c948184504d82b80e23eb3f4ff6cdfd328ba9355,
  publication57e1c363 tree-equivalent. Did not reapply the obsolete getter fix.
- Found one real old-patch conflict in test_ft_wbuf.cc. Extracted the exact
  repaired c948 physical-clock fixture, added ideal options, retained test
  bodies verbatim. Source audit records the conflict/resolution and exact
  unchanged producer FT include, two repair tests and host-scope bytes.
- Implemented the minimal I_READ_HIT host-reference hook after successful
  clean/drained native prefill. Selected sector bytes become unknown version0;
  other bytes/lines, response copies and monotonic producer clock are retained.
  Refusals precede reference/offset mutation. Later quiescent prefill remains
  allowed; no initial-only scope narrowing or numeric data invention.
- Tag touch uses native memcpy-offset time; bank/reply time stays physical.
- Added header and real-partition regression sources. Partition sequence covers
  GPU producer, dirty refusal, actual WB/clean eviction, later prefill, repeated
  prefill, held response and untouched sector. Expected old failure is described,
  not reported as an observed red/green result. Both C++ tests remain NOT_RUN.
- Frozen patch replay/round-trip and exact Core tree verified;2 changed Python
  tools syntax-checked; production driver help exposes --include-host-prefill
  without admission. Original18 overlays/modes checked, all18 NOT_RUN with
  null runtime keys/metrics. No I_BANK or matrix expansion.
- No unchanged66-test suite repeated. Five frozen packs/112 indexed files
  checksum-verified unchanged; no old raw/trace/binary rewrite or rerun.

## Real dependencies and resource boundary

Latest fetched Lane1 `85534de235345292a153d9983cfd0d24d8033bb2`
still binds uncompiled c948/Framework3ab150 and binary=null. Lane5
`e8f701995a27154ffcc54cc38245dde8cd7f9bdf` still provides no new
current-accepted application pair. A separate official R1.1 and current
repair+ideal qualification with same-binary B16 are absent. Candidate-source
completion never grants formal performance acceptance; old R0/R1 remain
withdrawn and1.721x remains historical.

The current shared registry file hash differs from CLIENT_CONTRACT's expected
hash (exact bytes in VALIDATION). Existing fail-closed loader refused before
any claim. The registry publisher's coherent update is required; no central
file was edited and no authority/cache fallback was introduced.

Metadata-only live check at 2026-10-16T17:07:32.586929+00:00: EP-L2 active
runs/leases0/0, own simulators0;2 observed live simulators
belong to DTC-L1. C16/other project data and processes were not modified.
Workspace f_bavail=29621444608B.
48GiB+2GiB formal build and original simulation/CPU/RAM policies are unchanged.
No compiler, production build, simulator, resource lease, migration or deletion
was invoked. Lane1 alone owns the disk GateWaiter; Lane4 created none.

Dependency fetches were bounded phase checks; no low-space admission retries,
repeated unchanged tests or hidden background worker. Waiter PID/lock/deadline
are null. Await the existing coordinator's exact release event, then rebind
source and use guarded finite C++ tests; do not call the static candidate an
accepted R1.1. Lane1 R0.1 and Lane5 first formal pairs retain priority.
